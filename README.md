❗ **THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED.**

Please, consider using some other similar tool, if the use-case is still valid.

The readme below is **outdated**.

Important Information
=================
Starting from **Firefox 57** and onwards, *WebExtensions* will be the only supported extension type, and *Firefox* will not load other types. Which mean that the actual version of **UNP won't work anymore**.

To be honest, I kind of lost interest in developping browser extension (and I'm not using UNP since years).

You can do whatever you want with this. It's now MIT licenced.

Still interested in using UNP?
=================
Even if new Firefox won't support this extension anymore, other browsers, like [Waterfox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/) and [Cyberfox](https://cyberfox.8pecxstudios.com), which are built on top of Firefox older versions - **would**. At least for some more time.

I've tried [Waterfox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/) as a replacement and it worked perfectly fine with the latest build of **Untamed Now Playing**.

Check [**Install > Latest unreviewed release**](#latest-release-recommended) section for installation instructions.


[Untamed Now Playing](https://github.com/Wylk/Untamed-Now-Playing-Next)
=================

**Untamed Now Playing** is a Firefox extension which parses the song title and artist from popular online radio/music sites, and writes it to a file on your hard drive. Programs such as Xsplit or OBS can then read the file and display it on an overlay, allowing viewers to easily see what song is currently being played.
Support Windows / Linux / OSX.

# Install
> Supported **Firefox**-based browser versions: **49** - **56**

## Latest release (recommended)
> **Unsigned**, can be easily installed on Firefox-based browsers (e.g. [Waterfox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/), [Cyberfox](https://cyberfox.8pecxstudios.com))

**Download** the latest build from [releases page](https://github.com/Wykks/Untamed-Now-Playing-Next/releases).

It will automatically promt you to install extension (
[short video explanation](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1umZOEK1NBpDHPk1FSOimFd_WfmNh2kE2)). If it does not, then drag the downloaded file onto a Firefox extension page (`about:addons`).

## Build Latest dev version (for advanced users)
To build UNP you'll need `npm` and `jpm`.

To install `npm`, read this: https://github.com/npm/npm#super-easy-install

Then install `jpm`:

    npm install jpm -g
And finally build UNP (do this where `package.json` is located):

    jpm xpi

Then drag generated `xpi` file onto a Firefox extension page (`about:addons`).


## On Mozilla Add-ons (version 4.5, outdated)
[![amo-button_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1236069/11095684/7c37b7d4-8896-11e5-9e3e-6b7913983a8c.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/untamed-now-playing/)

Configuration
--------------------------------------
Once you have installed the extension, you can find the options page by either right clicking the music note icon next to the address bar and selecting Options, or by finding "Untamed Now Playing" on the Extensions page and clicking Options.

The main option to configure is the "Save Directory". This is where the file containing the now playing data will be saved. The directory will also be used for caching if you enable the "Check stream is live" option. More information explaining each option can be found by clicking the info button on the right of each option.

Limitations
--------------------------------------
At the moment, now playing data is only saved when the song intially plays and is only updated when the next song starts playing. Thus if you stop playing music, the output file will still contain the last song played.

Firefox may limits what directories can be saved to, if you run into problems, try saving to a subdirectory of your profile (`C:\Users\USERNAME\*` or `C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\*`).

Known Issues
--------------------------------------
Nightbot support and Stream check features are not available.
