[Untamed Now Playing Next](https://github.com/Wylk/Untamed-Now-Playing-Next)
=================
"Untamed Now Playing Next" is a Chrome extension which parses the song title and artist from popular online radio/music sites, and writes it to a file on your hard drive. Programs such as Xsplit or OBS can then read the file and display it on an overlay, allowing viewers to easily see what song is currently being played. At the moment, this extension is Windows only.
This version ("Next") is the same as the original with some improvement by me (Wylk).

Install
--------------------------------------
There are a couple of ways to install the extension;

Important note
Chrome will now only install extensions from Googleâ€™s Web Store and deactivates all other installed extensions.
As a workaround you should be able to install the extension in dev mode (see "Install the unpacked extension")

For more informations : https://github.com/Wykks/Untamed-Now-Playing-Next/issues/7


### Install the unpacked extension (Under development)
1. Download the extension from Github [here](https://github.com/Niller2005/Untamed-Now-Playing-Next/archive/master.zip)
2. Extract the files to a safe place.
3. Open Chrome, click on the Spanner/Wrench icon -> Tools -> Extensions.
4. Tick "Developer mode" on the top right of the page.
5. Click "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to where you extracted the files in Step #2.

Note, the unpacked extension is from the development repository and thus may contain untested code and have bugs, so it's recommended you use the packed extension, which is always tested before release - unless you don't mind being a guinea pig :).

Configuration
--------------------------------------
Once you have installed the extension, you can find the options page by either right clicking the music note icon next to the address bar and selecting Options, or by finding "Untamed Now Playing" on the Extensions page and clicking Options.

The main option to configure is the "Save Directory". This is where the file containing the now playing data will be saved. The directory will also be used for caching if you enable the "Check stream is live" option. More information explaining each option can be found by clicking the info button on the right of each option.

Limitations
--------------------------------------
At the moment, now playing data is only saved when the song intially plays and is only updated when the next song starts playing. Thus if you stop playing music, the output file will still contain the last song played.

Chrome limits what directories can be saved to, if you run into problems, try saving to a subdirectory of your profile (C:\Users\USERNAME\* or C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\*).

Known Issues
--------------------------------------
Chrome under **Windows 8 in Metro mode** doesn't support NPAPI plugins, see [here](http://blog.chromium.org/2012/07/npapi-plug-ins-in-windows-8-metro-mode.html). There is also currently a bug in Chrome which causes NPAPI plugins to not work under **Windows 8 in Desktop mode**. A temporary work around is to run Chrome in Windows 7 compatability mode. This bug has already been reported to the Chrome team and has been confirmed.
